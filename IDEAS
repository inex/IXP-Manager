Potential Todo / Feature Ideas
------------------------------

* IP address state (history and reserved) - see #274

* API - "another thing that could potentially be useful.. the way you
  generate RIR objects.. if members could generate their macro and maybe
  import/exports based on the data route servers receive this could be
  useful.. especially keeping import/exports up to date with a lot of
  peering is a major pain.."

* "the peer2peer stats page does not scale well for networks with many peers.
  I think it could be an idea to make it configurable if you want the
  actual graphs or just a list where you can select which graphs you would
  like to see in one view"

* <nick-2128> you know what would be incredibly useful? an ixpmanager.php
  file which bleated about whether the correct modules are installed or not

* Review MRTG script for reseller and fanout ports

* INEX require that members peer "with at least the greater of 4 other
  Members, or 10% of other Members". A tool to list members failing this
  requirement would be useful.

* Email members on >80% of port utilisation

* Show who a member peers with (or not) on the overview page

* Member audit - port states, errors / discards, route collector session
  status, route server session status, etc.

* Would be useful to display last login information in the user edit screen or
  the list of users. Also the created by, last updated date?

* Show per-member peering matrix on member overview page?

* Member health report

* Allow member to modify template that Request Peering email is populated
  with when sending invite using "Peering Manager". Ideally there could be a
  list of predefined variables available that could be used while templating
  email (ie. peer name, peer ASN, own name, own ASN, own WWW, common peering
  LAN IPs, AS MACRO, peering email, NOC email and so on), so member could
  create own template using above variables + own text.

  Also consider adding maxprefixes to peering manager template (see #174).


* Add PeeringDB link to PM request template

* Update suggested prefix limit / real prefix limit based on IRRDB entries?

* Add ASN to graph titles

* Multiple P2P graphs for LAG ports

* "hose that you have bilateral peerings with is the difference between the
  'Peers' tab and the 'Potential Bilateral Peers' tab. But I'll add a note
  to add a tab that also shows this."


* Maintenance Announcements / Diary  -was issue #30.
  * Page for upcoming scheduled maintenance
  * Select affected switches and generate a list of affected members (Name,
    ASN, IPv4, IPv6 addresses)
  * Add notification when members login, especially affected members, link
    to maintenance pages.

* Have a "private" directory analogous to the "public" one,with files only
  loadable by logged in users. See issue #71.

* Per location member statistics graphs to show all member traffic is a
  specific location - see issue #204

* An annual (or more frequent?) email to members reminding them of their
  subscriptions. Also email to custadmins reminding them of their users.
  Probably staggered over the year to prevent a flux of inbound emails.
