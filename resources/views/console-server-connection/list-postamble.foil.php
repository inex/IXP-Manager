            Out of band access (for emergencies, firmware upgrades, etc) is normally achieved with the use of a console server of some form.
            These devices provide console port access to switches. Depending on your console server type, it may not have an easy interface
            for recording what port is connected to what device. You can use this page to record those details yourself.
