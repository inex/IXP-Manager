<h1>Traffic Deltas Report :: <?= $t->day->format('l') ?></h1>

<p>
    The traffic deltas report shows member traffic profiles that have changed based on
    <?= $t->stddev ?> times the standard deviation. This report compares like for like
    traffic by only considering same day traffic. I.e. Traffic on a Tuesday for every
    Tuesday over the past x weeks.
