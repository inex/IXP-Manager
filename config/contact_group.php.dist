;; Contact Group Types
;;
;; Contacts can be added to various groups, and these groups are categorised by type.
;;
;; Define here any contact group types you like. Note that the ROLE type is special and
;; removing it will disable the contact role form elements. It is intended to assign roles
;; to contacts such as 'Admin', 'Billing', 'Technical', 'Marketing'. These are set up
;; by the default fixtures.
