## Documentation

For a period, some older v3 documentation may still be useful. You can find that on 
the [wiki](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki).

## About IXP Manager

For detailed information, see: https://www.ixpmanager.org/

IXP Manager is primarily a web application with associated scripts and
utilities which will allow IXPs to manage new customers, provision new
connections / services and monitor traffic usage. It also has a self
contained customer portal allowing IXP members to view their IXP traffic
statistics and a unique tool called My Peering Manager enabling IXP
members to request, manage and track peerings with other members.

[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) is an Internet eXchange Point and Ireland's IP 
peering hub. It is a neutral, industry-owned Association, founded in 1996, 
that provides IP peering facilities for its members. INEX membership is open 
to all organisations that can benefit from peering their IP traffic.
